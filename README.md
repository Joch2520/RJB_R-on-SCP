# Roget/RJB_R's work on SCP wiki

This repository contains the work of pixelatedharmony while under the name of [Roget/RJB_R](https://www.wikidot.com/user:info/RJB_R), and serves merely an archival purpose to reflect the work in their unaltered state. This repository is automatically retrieved and generated from Wikidot page revisions using [wdotcrawl](https://github.com/Joch2520/wdotcrawl).

As pixelatedharmony does not want most of the work to be associated with her current name, she has decided to release all of RJB_R's work **other than** collaborations and [those listed in her current author page](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/pixelatedharmonyauthorpage) to the SCP community, open for rewrites and remixes. For details, see [this post by pixelatedharmony](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-13983737/pixelatedharmonyauthorpage#post-4879711).
