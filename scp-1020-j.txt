**Item #:** SCP-1020-J

**Object Class:** --FÅ“tor;-- Neutralized 

**Containment & Neutralization Summary:** Formerly non-anomalous contraband held by Junior Researcher Alleyn, who has been sacked, SCP-1020-J's furry, slimy, yet simultaneously scaly and powdery form came into existence subsequently to Site-77's controlled evacuation and lockdown[[footnote]]As part of the successful effort to prevent a novel pathogen spreading from the civilian population to full-time Foundation personnell[[/footnote]]. The contents of SCP-1020-J prior to this are unknown, and attempts to take samples resulted in the equipment becoming disgusting beyond usability before any readings could be made.

Inside of SCP-1020-J is a self-sustaining boutique blend of garbage, visually comparable to a protoplasmic cube composed of and containing the rotting curdling, self-bleach-proofed dregs, of what once may have been edible foodstuffs. 

The stink wave unleashed by opening its door can be detected from inside a ground-level enclosed structure by sniffer dogs from a distance of 2.5 kilometers. Survivors of direct exposure have not been able to compare it to other odors due to the obliteration of their olfactory nerves.
